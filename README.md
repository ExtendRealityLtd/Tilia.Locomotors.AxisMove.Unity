## Introduction

The axis move prefabs collection provides a number of mechanisms for moving a GameObject around based on axis input.

A number of movement types are provided such as:

* `Slide` - Smoothly move forward/backwards and strafe left/right.
* `Warp` - Warp instantly forward/backward with a camera blink between each movement.
* `Smooth Rotate` - Smoothly rotate around a pivot point.
* `Snap Rotate` - Rotate 45 degrees with a blink of the camera between each rotation.

> **Requires** the Unity software version `2018.3.10f1` (or above).
